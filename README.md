# Python-Challenge
 Module 3

I tried using a "Def" method of trying to get data, but I wasn't able to debug that properly.
I opted to proceed with a series of "if" checks and "+1" to get my results.
I imagine there's a more efficient method, but this was what felt most natural.
I checked my results on some of the excel data and everything looks good.
Fingers crossed my methodology is acceptable.
I want to mention that I opted to utilize jupyter to debug my code, but made sure the final code worked as a standalone file.
I don't believe using jupyter this way is problematic, but I apologize if I'm mistaken.
I opted to keep these Debug tests on here for transparency. 

Thank you




BTW: I'm still a bit confused about how to best format these read-me's, so my apologies if it looks weird.
